            <h2>What is the Tradition Keepers program?</h2>
            <p>The Tradition Keepers program is a collaboration between the Ramblin' Reck Club and the Georgia Tech Alumni Association that aims to foster campus-wide participation in our cherished school traditions! By submitting photos as you and your friends complete various traditions and challenges, you can qualify for a number of different prizes and keep Tech traditions going strong.
