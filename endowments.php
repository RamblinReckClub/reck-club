    <h3 class="mb-3">Why need an endowment?</h3>
    <hr class="mb-3">

    <p>Being an 80-year-old car, the Ramblin’ Reck requires frequent maintenance and part replacement which costs upward of $10,000 annually.  However, the Institute itself does not provide any funds for the Reck. The preservation and presentation of this unique icon is almost entirely supported through fees from non-official appearances, generous alumni donations, and the Ramblin’ Reck Club due.  As a result, the Reck is frequently transported around Georgia for weddings, parties, and various other functions in an effort to raise the necessary funds. The Dean Dull Endowment and Class of 1964 50th Reunion endowments enable the Reck Club to draw from a solid foundation for annual maintenance, upkeep, fuel, etc. for the Ramblin’ Reck. In addition to necessary maintenance, the endowment will cover unforeseen costs that are difficult to budget for or mitigate with savings.  As the official mascot of Georgia Tech, it is assumed the Ramblin’ Reck will represent the Institute at high-profile events such as the 2004 Final Four in San Antonio, Texas, or the 2010 Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.  Only through the giving of our dedicated alumni and friends can the club cover the added cost to transport the Reck to and from these events while ensuring the car’s protection on the road.  The Class of 1984 25th Reunion Class generously donated a truck that the Reck Driver uses to transport the Reck. This donation is a tremendous help in relieving the additional financial burdens of displaying our unique icon.  The endowments will ensure the presence of the Reck when celebrating future achievements of the Institute with alumni and fans.

    <h4 class="mb-3">How the endowment work?</h4>
    <hr class="mb-3">
    <p>The Georgia Tech Foundation will maintain the Dean Dull Ramblin’ Reck Endowment and the Class of 1964 50th Reunion Endowment.  The Ramblin’ Reck Club and the Driver will draw funds from the returns on the overall investment for the maintenance, preservation, and promotion of the Ramblin’ Reck as an icon of the Georgia Institute of Technology. With the addition of the Class of 1964 50th Reunion Endowment, Reck Club is able to maintain the Reck pristinely and have a financial safety net to cover unexpected costs. We are so grateful for the generous donations made by the Class of 1964 and Georgia Tech alumni and friends. The Reck could not continue to be as visible a mascot for the Georgia Tech community without your support. Thank you!
