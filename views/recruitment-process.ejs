</ul>

<h4 class="mb-3">Written Application</h4>

<p>The 2018 Ramblin’ Reck Club application is now closed. Check back next December for 2019's application!</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">Information Sessions (Non-Mandatory)</h4>

<p>For anyone interested in learning more about Ramblin’ Reck Club, what we are involved in on campus, opportunities within the Club, and the recruitment process, we will be hosting three non-mandatory information sessions before the application deadline closes. Feel free to stop in and introduce yourself and get the low-down on all things RRC during one of the following sessions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Tuesday, January 16</strong>: East Architecture Room 207 from 6:00pm-7:00pm</li>
    <li><strong>Thursday, January 18</strong>: East Architecture Room 107 from 6:00pm-7:00pm</li>
    <li><strong>Tuesday, January 23</strong>: East Architecture Room 207 from 6:00pm-7:00pm</li>
    <li><strong>First Social: Monday, January 29th at 7:15pm (Mandatory)</strong></li>
</ul>

    <p>Attending this social is your chance as an applicant to meet Reck Clubbers for the first time, get a feel for what Ramblin’ Reck Club is all about, ask any questions you may have about the Club or getting involved, and most importantly, sign up for an interview time. No need to stress about this event; be yourself and talk to anyone you do not already know! Dress code for this event is <strong>business casual</strong>, and will be hosted in the Edge Building Trophy Room (on the corner of Techwood and Bobby Dodd).</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">RRC/Athletics Bonding (Mandatory)</h4>

<p>In order to provide applicants a casual setting to interact with Reck Clubbers and get a better feel for the kind of spirit Reck Club has for Georgia Tech, all applicants must attend one of the following GT Athletic events. Please note that applicants need only attend one of the following athletic events in order to satisfy the recruitment requirements:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Thursday, January 18th</strong>: Men’s Basketball game vs. UVA at 8pm in McCamish Pavilion</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Saturday, January 20th</strong>: Men’s Basketball game @ UNC at 2pm in the Student Center Theater
        <dfn>
            <span class="text-muted">Please note: this event will be a viewing party in the Student Center Theater since the game is away.</span>
        </dfn>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sunday, January 28th</strong>: Women’s  Basketball game vs. UVA at 1pm in McCamish Pavilion</li>
    <li><strong>Interviews: Tuesday, January 30th through Thursday, February 1st from 5:30-9pm (Mandatory)</strong></li>
</ul>

    <p>The interview portion of RECKruitment is designed to allow for Reck Clubbers to get to know applicants on a more personal basis. No need to stress! We just want to give each applicant the time to express their ideas, commitment, and personality. The interview stage will include a 20 minute individual interview followed by a short group interview activity. Dress code for this event is <strong>business semi-formal</strong>, and will be hosted in the Student Success Center Skyboxes. <a href="http://admission.gatech.edu/visit/bill-moore-student-success-center">Click here</a> for directions to the building, and be on the lookout for directions inside the building to the Skyboxes once you arrive. Interviewees will sign up for an interview time slot during check-in at the first social on Monday, January 29th.</p>

<p>After all interviews have been conducted, the Recruitment Chair will notify each applicant whether they will advance to the second round of RECKruitment. During this second round, applicants will attend a mandatory second social (invitation only) held on the evening of Monday, February 5th. Further details for this event will be published to applicants personally.</p>

    <p>Any time conflicts with these events should be brought to the attention of <a href="mailto:membershipchair@reckclub.org">Margaret Dickey</a>, Ramblin’ Reck Club Recruitment Chair, no later than <strong>Saturday, January 27th</strong>.</p>


    <p>We wish you the best of luck during this recruitment process, and we look forward to meeting you soon! Thank you for considering joining Ramblin’ Reck Club!</p>
