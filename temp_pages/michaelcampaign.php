        <p>Michael Edwin Eckert (BME 1971) was born 05/31/1947 and died 11/28/2023.  Mike loved Georgia Tech and was a long-time season ticket holder for football.  He loved going to games and retelling stories of his days as a student and just how difficult Georgia Tech was!  Mike is survived by his wife Kristen and his four children, Allison, Michael, Coreen, and Nathaniel.  As he would say, GO JACKETS!</p>
