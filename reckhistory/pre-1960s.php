New fenders on the rear have restored her shapely form and hidden her spindly axles. A new top has given the needed touch of seasoned smart- ness and an enveloping coat of paint has been imposed upon her lovely tin body. Thus we have with us yet "our own original Ramblin' Wreck" locking daintier, and, as the dean himself puts it, "Better than ever."'</p>

                          <p>After the Tech administration declares the "Flying Flivver Race" unsafe, the Yellow Jacket Club reorganizes the race into a parade of 'wrecks' on campus. Student organizations are encouraged to build heavily-modified and decorated cars and contraptions to show off to campus and be judged for technical complexity and creativity. Dean Field and his 1916 Model T lead the first parade, won by participants from the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Today, the race is led by the modern-day Ramblin' Reck and has evolved to include three categories - classic cars, fixed-bodies, and contraptions. Throughout the years, painstaking effort has been invested to ensure the parade does not turn into a procession of fancy floats and maintain the technical and ingenious character of the Georgia Tech student body.</p>

Later that month, ANAK, with the help of a few determined Yellow Jacket Club members, created a new organization to manage school spirit - the Ramblin' Reck Club. To avoid the domination of specific Greek organizations, the founders of the new club mandated that each Greek organization could only send up to two members to the club.</p>
