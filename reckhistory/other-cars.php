                  The Centennial Reck is a 1931 Ford Model A Cabriolet that was restored and refurbished in preparation for the
                  Institute's 1985 centennial celebration. This car, along with the Reck, led the football team out onto Grant Field
                  for every home game of the 1985 football season. After the season, it was raffled off for $250,000. The winner of
                  the raffle later sold the car to Pete George, who kept it until 1991. George later sold it to the Tasca Ford dealership
                  in Massachusetts, where it still sits today.

                  The Alumni Association purchased a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster in 1988 and refurbished it for event use starting in
                  1994. The vehicle is notably different from the actual Reck: it lacks flag poles, has spare tire holders on the
                  running-boards, "Georgia Tech Alumni Association" printed across the doors, and a convertible top.

                  During the late 1990s, Bill Bulpitt of GT Energy and John Carter of the Tech Foundation purchased a 1930 Ford Model
                  A Sports Coupe to sit in the lobby of the Georgia Tech Hotel. The motor is incomplete, most of the electrical
                  wiring has been removed, the car lacks the chrome stone guard of the real Reck, and the rumble seat has been
                  converted into a trunk, but it has been painted and refurbished to look almost exactly like the Reck.
