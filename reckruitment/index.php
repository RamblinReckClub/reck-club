    <p>Every spring semester, Ramblin’ Reck Club holds RECKruitment in order to take in a new class of probates (probationary members). These probates are selected from a pool of applicants who must first submit an application and attend a series of RECKruitment events. This year's RECKruitment cycle will be held in-person with appropriate COVID-19 precautions (mask wearing, social distancing, and testing) being observed. Any issues related to COVID-19 quarantine/isolation will be worked out on a case-by-case basis. Email <a href="mailto:membershipchair@reckclub.org">Derek Prusener and Abi Ivemeyer</a>, Ramblin' Reck Club Membership Co-Chairs, if you have questions or concerns. Find the breakdown of these events below:</p>

<h4 class="mb-2">Tips for RECKruitment</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Be yourself! We want to get to know you and why you love Georgia Tech!</li>
    <li>Have fun! The socials and "Get To Know You" events will have fun activities and should not feel like an interview; that's what the interview is for.</li>
    <li>Meet as many members as possible across the socials and "Get To Know You" events. Don't be afraid to ask a member you already know to introduce you to someone new.</li>
    <li>Put time and effort into your application. Follow the suggested word counts for each question to make sure you answer it fully.</li>
    <li>While dress codes are listed for both the socials and interview, we understand there may be circumstances that may prevent some applicants from having proper attire. Don't sweat it, we just want to see you there regardless! If you do need assistance with interview clothing, <a href="https://career.gatech.edu/campus-closet-open">Georgia Tech's Campus Closet</a> provides this service free of charge to students.</li>
