The purpose of the points system is to encourage all Reck Club members/probates to become more active in the club through attendance and participation at Georgia Tech and Reck Club events. It is intended to reward members/probates for their dedication to furthering the goals of the club and also to foster a uniquely strong social environment in which all members/probates enjoy one another's company and can count on one another for advice and support.<br/><br/>
Although there are teams, the points system is not meant to divide the club, but to bring it together.<br/><br/>
Although there are rankings, the points system is not meant to evaluate the club, but to show the value that we as a whole bring to the Georgia Tech community.<br/><br/>
Although there are winners, the points system is not meant to glorify high attendance, but to recognize one of many ways that a member/probate can contribute to the club.<br/><br/>
Competition is encouraged, but never at the expense of the club. If, at any time, the points competition is deemed by the executive committee to be causing behavior that is detrimental to the continued success of the club, the executive committee reserves the right to end the points competition indefinitely.

<tr><td>
All socials must include the attendance of five (5) or more members/probates.<br/><br/>
The social must represent a legitimate attempt to bring Reck Club members/probates together in a social environment.<br/><br/>
If the executive committee determines that these criteria were not met or that an attempt was made to exclude and/or prevent any members/probates from attending, the social will not be counted.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
To secure points for any points-bearing activity, a member/probate must remain at said points-bearing activity for at least half (1/2) of the duration of the activity.<br/><br/>
This does not include extra innings or overtime of any kind.<br/><br/>
If a member/probate attends an activity, but does not remain for the specified minimum duration of time, then that member/probate should not count that activity towards their points total.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
A points-bearing activity of any kind may not be "checked off" as attended by a member/probate until said member/probate has remained in attendance at said points-bearing
 activity for the specified minimum duration of time.<br/><br/>
Any member/probate found to be guilty of "pre-checking" events will suffer a points deduction, the magnitude of which will be determined by the executive committee based on the point 
value of the "pre-checked" event and the number of previous infractions committed by the "pre-checker".
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
By clicking "Update" on any of the Points Update Webpages, a member/probate certifies that they have previously attended for the specified minimum duration of time 
all points-bearing activities that they have "checked off" on the respective Points Update Form.<br/><br/>
Any member/probate found to be guilty of "points fraud" will suffer a points deduction, the magnitude of which will be determined by the executive committee based on the point value 
of the fraudulent event and the number of previous infractions committed by the "points hustler".
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
All other contingencies, discrepancies, and incongruities will be mediated according to the discretion of the points administrator and the executive committee.<br/><br/>
All decisions, revisions, and permissions made by the points administrator and the executive committee are binding and final.
