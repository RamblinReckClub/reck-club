    <h2 class="mb-3">What is Ramblin’ Reck Club?</h2>
    <hr class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Ramblin’ Reck Club</strong> is a premier Georgia Tech student organization that promotes campus spirit and traditions through the Institute’s mechanical mascot, the <em>Ramblin’ Reck</em>. Our mission is to spread joy to students, faculty, and alumni throughout the year. From administering Tech’s famous Homecoming events, <a href="https://reckclub.org.gatech.edu/homecoming/mini-500.php" target="_blank">Mini 500</a>, <a href="https://reckclub.org.gatech.edu/homecoming/cake-race.php" target="_blank">Freshman Cake Race</a>, and <a href="https://reckclub.org.gatech.edu/homecoming/wreck-parade.php" target="_blank">Wreck Parade</a>, to organizing freshman experiences such as <a href="https://reckclub.org.gatech.edu/t-night.php" target="_blank">Traditions Night (T-Night)</a> and the <a href="https://reckclub.org.gatech.edu/about/t-book.php" target="_blank">T-Book</a>, the club’s impacts reach far beyond the extents of the Reck.</p>

    <p>In order to promote campus-wide spirit, we serve the campus through working relationships with the Georgia Tech Athletic Association, the Georgia Tech Alumni Association, and the student body at-large. Ramblin’ Reck Club is comprised of various committees that are intended to help serve campus in different ways, from supporting Tech Olympic (non-revenue) sports to partnering with other campus organizations. If there is a way to boost spirit and morale around campus, Ramblin’ Reck Club is ready and willing to help! We have been involved in executing regularly occurring events such as <strong>Bookmobile</strong>, a student book exchange, <strong>Headshots with the Reck</strong>, a semesterly event that allows students to take a professional headshot next to the Reck for use on professional media outlets, Ride Days for campus organizations, and many more! One of our favorites is <strong>GTIF</strong>, meaning “Georgia Tech, it’s Friday!”.</p>

    <p>At GTIFs, we help promote upcoming Georgia Tech football, basketball, baseball, and volleyball games. You can also find us sharing our Tech spirit at any of GT’s sports, most notably participating in one of college football’s greatest run-outs and energetically cheering on our teams from the front rows of Bobby Dodd, McCamish, Russ-Chandler, O’Keefe, Mewborn, and even rivals’ stadiums during our thrilling road trips!</p>

    <p>In addition to promoting campus spirit, Ramblin’ Reck Club also strives to share, facilitate, and preserve the traditions that our illustrious Institute is built upon. Reck Club proudly oversees several historic Georgia Tech traditions. During Homecoming, the club upholds and executes three of Georgia Tech’s favorite traditions. <strong>Mini 500</strong> is an exhilarating 7-lap tricycle race around Peters Parking Deck. <strong>Freshman Cake Race</strong> is a fun half-mile race through campus during sunrise on the day of the Homecoming football game. And, finally, <strong>Ramblin’ Wreck Parade</strong> is a showcase of student and alumni contraptions, fixed bodies, and classic cars that celebrates ingenuity and fosters Georgia Tech pride just in time for the Homecoming game festivities to begin!</p>

    <p><a href="https://reckclub.org.gatech.edu/traditionkeepers/" target="_blank">Traditions Keepers</a> is a program for all Georgia Tech students to participate in fun traditions that all students and alumni can share from their time on campus in the past 100+ years. We take great pride in helping to promote and preserve all of these traditions through presentations and trivia events on campus.</p>

    <p>With as much work as we do together, we feel it is important to have fun in good company while doing it! While Ramblin’ Reck Club is a student organization, we often refer to ourselves as a <em>family</em>. With only 55 members, it doesn’t take long to get to know everyone while going to sporting events, planning our own socials, playing intramurals together, and participating in fun trips! Some examples include semi-formal dances, Spring Break trips, cabin weekends, camping trips, road trips to away games, experiences around Atlanta, and many other spontaneous events. Many of your Reck Club peers become some of your greatest life-long friends through your memorable time in the club!</p>
